The data folder within my local repository contains one file (berkeley_dataset.csv). This csv file contains records of applicants, with details about the year and major they applied for, their gender and admission decision. This dataset was used for the UC Berkeley Sex-Based Admission Discrimination data analysis, which can be accessed as a Quarto Markdown file in the 'code' folder of this remote repository.
